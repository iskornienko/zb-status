# Status UI for zenbot v4.0 (cryptocurrency trading bot)

*Research/prototype code ... pardon the mess.*

### Motivation
Zenbot is an easy way to automate cryptocurrency trading. Whether automating crypto trading is a good idea is an excellent question, but regardless, zenbot lacked a good UI for tracking trading activity. This is why I decided to build my own.

### Current State
With time and experimentation I discovered that algorithmic trading of cryptocurrency was not for me.
